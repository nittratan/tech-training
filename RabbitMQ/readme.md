# RabbitMQ on MacBook

##  What is RabbitMQ?
RabbitMQ is an open-source **message broker** that enables applications to communicate asynchronously using message queues. It decouples services, handles traffic spikes, and ensures reliable message delivery.

### Key Concepts:
- **Producer**: Application that sends messages
- **Consumer**: Application that receives messages  
- **Queue**: Temporary storage for messages
- **Exchange**: Routes messages to queues (Types: Direct, Fanout, Topic, Headers)
